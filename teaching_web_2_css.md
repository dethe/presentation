# Week 2: CSS



Last week we took a whirlwind tour of HTML, CSS, Javascript, with a little bit of SVG, to give an idea of all the moving parts.

And we got to play around with the `<div>` element and some basic CSS for positioning, sizing, and changing colours.

Today, we're going to look at more CSS (we will come back to HTML and explore other tags later).



# Units

One of the keys to understanding CSS is to understand units. Nearly every number in CSS is expressed along with the units it is measured in. Last week we kept ourselves to pixels units (`px`), but there are many options and they all have their uses.

# Colors

Colors are another confusing area in CSS, because there are many ways to express them.

# Positioning

We've already explored positioning, but there is more that we can do.

* Nesting
* Absolute / Relative / Fixed / Etc.
* Responsive Design (mobile-first)
* Tables: Evil or Just Wrong
* Grid systems
* Flexboxes: the new hotness
* And yes, there is more.



# Sizing

Again, we've covered sizing somewhat, but should explore in more depth.

* Setting width vs. setting height
* Natural sizes
* Padding, Margin, Borders, Outlines



# Fonts and Text

This is a big (BIG) topic and we're not going to go over every possible aspect of it. What we will do is go over adding custom fonts, why you need a fallback for those, what some of the common CSS rules are for text and fonts, and as a bonus: how to use icon fonts.



# Generated Content

CSS has several ways to add new content to the page. You can have rules to add content before and/or after a matching tag. You can specify bullets and numbering styles for outlines. And you can add many interesting effects using borders, shadows, and background patterns.



# Images and Sprites

Backgrounds don't have to just be patterns, they can also be images loaded from the web, and CSS gives you a great deal of control over how these background images are displayed, which we can leverage for different purposes.
